IMPORTANT
- script to update etc/hosts or a better way

NICE
- set config settings in web
- reset secret
- debug long time issue in pinger (DNS lookup?)
- add name leasing (every new computer gets a name and a code - avoids name conflicts)
- remove old entries (with leasing you could require periodic re-leasing)
